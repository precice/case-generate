## Project Overview

This project uses **preCICE** for a multiphysics simulation involving:

- Solver `ASolver` with participant `Generator-Left`
- Solver `ASolver` with participant `Generator-Right`
- Solver `BSolver` with participant `Propagator`

### Project Structure

Global files that are generated are: `precice-config.xml`, `README.md` and `clean.sh`. Additionally, for each participant, a folder with an `adapter-config.json` and a `run.sh` file are created.
The folder structure is as follows:

```
_generated/
 ├── README.md			# This file
 ├── clean.sh			# Clean up script
 ├──generator-left-asolver/
 │   ├── adapter-config.json
 │   └── run.sh			# Not yet implemented
 ├──generator-right-asolver/
 │   ├── adapter-config.json
 │   └── run.sh			# Not yet implemented
 ├──propagator-bsolver/
 │   ├── adapter-config.json
 │   └── run.sh			# Not yet implemented
 └── precice-config.xml		# Global precice-config.xml file
```


- `precice-config.xml` is the global preCICE configuration file which defines the parameters and communication of participants
- `adapter-config.json` is a configuration file to couple the solvers with preCICE.
- `run.sh` is a script that is meant to execute a participant. Note, however, that since different solvers are executed differently, this file is not implemented yet.
- `clean.sh` removes any files in the current root directory that were not created by preCICE case-generate (and moves them to a backup folder).
Execution:

```bash
./clean.sh [--force] [--dry-run]
```

- `--force` Deletes the files and any backup folders
- `--dry-run` Does not delete any files, but prints files that would be deleted

## Prerequisites

Before running the simulation, ensure you have the following installed:

- The preCICE coupling library
- Solver `ASolver` and its dependencies
- Solver `ASolver` and its dependencies
- Solver `BSolver` and its dependencies

---

## Running the Simulation

### Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to the `_generated` folder
cd _generated/

# Implement the run script

# Make the run script executable 
chmod +x run.sh

# Execute the simulation
./run.sh
```
